Phylogenetics
=============

So, the basic functions *should* work by now. But there are still some functions that I did not implement, yet. The current status is in `status.csv`.

The script `phylogenetics.py` can be imported as module, `phylotree.py` not (yet) reasonably. All `txt` files and the `html` file are needed for the initialization of new projects.

Both, `phylogenetics.py` and `phylotree.py` can be called directly. Use the `-h` or `--help` flag to get information about the usage.
