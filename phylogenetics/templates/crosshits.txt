# List of protein names to use for crosshit analysis
# Use one name per line. Empty lines and everything after a hash is ignored.

# If you want to get crosscrosshits, write:
# !crosscrosshits N N N ...
# Where N N N ... are numbers defining the cluster size. If you omit the cluster size, the default 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 50 will be used.
#
# Example: `!crosscrosshits 1 2 3 10 20` -> all species with 1, 2, 3, 4-10, 11-20, 21+ crosscrosshits will be clustered.
